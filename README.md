# Downloads Organiser

When this program is run it will organise your downloads folder into seperate categories

## Pylint

Added pylint to test the quality of my code. Had to add some disable/ignore while I get a better understanding of these.

```python
# pylint: disable=missing-module-docstring
# pylint: disable=missing-class-docstring
# pylint: disable=missing-function-docstring
```

# Roadmap

<ul>
    <li>Added Pylint to GitHub Actions to check code quality.  âœ”</li>
    <li>Create document sub folder for further organisation. </li>
</ul>
